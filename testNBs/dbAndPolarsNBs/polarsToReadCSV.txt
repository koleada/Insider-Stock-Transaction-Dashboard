** note we can also import polars dataframe into sql DB which could be useful in for populating the database with the rest of the insider trade info. **

polar supports reading only specifc columns in from tsv files as well. 

code:
***** have heard that sep='\t' doesnt work so trying using delimiter='\t' *****

**** scan_csv IS RECCOMENDED FOR LARGE DATA SETS SO TRY THIS FIRST ****

import polars as pl




# Path to your TSV file
data_path = "your_data.tsv"

# Define the desired columns you want to extract
desired_columns = ["column1", "column3"]

# Scan the TSV file (lazy loading)
lf = pl.scan_csv(data_path, sep="\t")

# Select only the desired columns and collect the DataFrame (materialize)
extracted_df = lf.select(desired_columns).collect()  # Replace with .filter(...) if needed

# Print the extracted DataFrame
print(extracted_df)

OR COULD TRY
-------------

import polars as pl

# Path to your TSV file
data_path = "your_data.tsv"

# Read the TSV file into a DataFrame
df = pl.read_csv(data_path, sep="\t")  # Specify tab separator 

# Define the column names you want to extract
desired_columns = ["column1", "column3"]  # Replace with your actual column names

# Select only the desired columns into a new DataFrame
extracted_df = df[desired_columns]

# Print the extracted DataFrame
print(extracted_df)
