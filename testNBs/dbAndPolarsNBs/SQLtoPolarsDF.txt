we can put a sql query directly into a polar dataframe for processing. 

once all of the data is in the sqlite db, we can make the main program that will import a table into a polar dataframe. the table names are the names of the stock ticker. 
importing to dataframe will keep all the correct column names and stuff too. 

once in the dataframe we can process and visualize the data accordingly and it will be fast, intuitive and efficient

code:

import polars as pl

# Connect to your database (replace with your connection details)
conn = sqlite3.connect("your_database.db")  # Assuming SQLite

# Define the SQL query
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM your_table_name"  # Replace with your actual query

# Read the results into a DataFrame
df = pl.read_database(sql_query, connection=conn)

# Print the column names
print(df.columns)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
